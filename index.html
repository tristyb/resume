    <h2>Profile</h2>
    <p class="intro">I'm a front-end developer / web designer. I think web designer is the better term but you know, it's confusing. I've been making websites for over 4 and a half years now as a freelancer and at agencies/startups.</p>
		<p>I enjoy using responsive technologies to build websites and it's mostly all I've ever known, making fixed-width sites seems so strange to me. Asides from loving my career path I enjoy spending time with my wife, my pet guinea pigs and chasing that darn Wild Hunt.</p>
