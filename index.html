        <p class="profile__text profile__text--lede">Hey ðŸ‘‹ I'm a front-end developer. I've been making websites for over 11 years now as a freelancer and at agencies/startups.</p>

        <p class="profile__text">I enjoy using front-end technologies, new ones and the classics, to build websites and I am also versed in back-end technologies and am capable of building an entire site myself. Asides from loving my career path I enjoy spending time walking, chatting (a *lot*), doodling whilst sipping a nice cup of Twinings Everyday and playing games with my friends.</p>
