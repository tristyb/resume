    <h2>Profile</h2>
    <p>I'm a freelance front-end developer. I've been making websites for over 3 and a half years now as a freelancer and at agencies. I enjoy using responsive technologies to build websites and it's mostly all I've ever known, making fixed-width sites seems so strange to me. Asides from loving my job I enjoy spending time with my wife, my pet guinea pigs and doing my Destiny chores.</p>
