<section class="profile">
  <h2>Profile</h2>
  <p class="intro">I'm a front-end developer / web designer. I've been making websites for over 6 and a half years now as a freelancer and at agencies/startups.</p>
  <p>I enjoy using responsive technologies to build websites and it's mostly all I've ever known, making fixed-width sites seems so strange to me. Asides from loving my career path I enjoy spending time with my wife, my pet guinea pigs and sipping a nice cup of Yorkshire gold.</p>
